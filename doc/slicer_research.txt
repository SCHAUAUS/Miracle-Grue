The slicer and pather modules perform geometry computations. 

We are looking solid algorithms for our computational geometry needs and a library with a good licence and convenient data structures in C++.

This file is a collection of ideas and links to relevant information.


== Polygon Intersection:

Also known as clipping algorithm

Another strategy for polygon intersection is to first go through a polygon triangulation phase first, because intersection between triangles is an easy problem.

Simpler than WeilerAtherton, one of the polygons must be convex

this algorithm is implemented in CGAL.
